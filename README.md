Problem Statement : Create a signup page where a user can register, a login page to log in with the necessary details needed during registration. Successful login should redirect to a profile page which should contain additional details such as age, dob, contact, etc. The user can update, Flow : Register > Login > Profile

Condition:

● HTML, JS, CSS, and PHP code should be in separate files, none of the codes must co-exist in the same file.

● Only use Jquery AJAX for interacting with the backend (strictly no usage of form submission).

● CSS can be used but the form must be designed in bootstrap in order to maintain page responsiveness.

● Use MySql for storing the registered data and MongoDB for Storing the details of the user profiles

● In MySQL always use Prepared Statements, with no usage of simple SQL statements.

● The login session should be maintained only using browser localstorage (Do not use PHP Session)

● Use Redis to store the session information in the backend.

NOTE:


Thus the above conditions are almost done ,but redis are not used because i need some time to learn that ,but definitely i will learn redis in future
